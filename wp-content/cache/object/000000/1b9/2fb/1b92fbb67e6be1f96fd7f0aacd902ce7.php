Your therapist will also consider aspects of your functioning and parenting style that may impact on your parenting, which may require you to complete questionnaires. Your therapist will then formulate a treatment plan, and work with you on strategies to appropriately address difficulties that you are experiencing with parenting your child. Your therapist will help you tailor these strategies to your fmily and may role-play these strategies with you in sessions. You will be required to use these techniques with your child in between sessions. Your therapist will also work with you at each session to address any difficulties you have in successfully implementing strategies with your child. The Triple P program aims not only to assist you with current parenting difficulties, but to provide you with a range of strategies that you will be able to generalise to a variety of problems that may arise as your child moves through developmental stages.</p>";}

Although clinical psychologists frequently have doctoral degrees and are referred to as ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù, they do not have medical degrees, and are not able to prescribe medications. Rather, psychologists assess clients and then use scientifically supported therapies (for example, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) in working with clients to achieve their goals, improve their quality of life, and function more healthily and effectively on a day-to-day basis. Psychologists, therefore, help clients with a wide range of problems, including changing behaviours (e.g., smoking, problems with eating or motivation), managing stress, and clinical diagnoses, such as depression and anxiety. Psychiatrists, on the other hand, study for six years to obtain a general medical degree, and then complete further study to gain additional qualifications in the area of mental health. They may prescribe medication and use therapy-based strategies to treat mental health problems. Psychologists and psychiatrists often work together. Some psychiatrists focus primarily on medication, and refer clients to psychologists for non-medical therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy).</p>";}s:23:"_add_a_faq_0_faq_answer";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_55ad02e1c0149";}s:24:"add_a_faq_1_faq_question";a:1:{i:0;s:12:"What is CBT?";}s:25:"_add_a_faq_1_faq_question";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_55ad02c5c0148";}s:22:"add_a_faq_1_faq_answer";a:1:{i:0;s:265:"<p>CBT or ‚ÄúCognitive Behavioural Therapy‚Äù is a form of therapy that helps clients to identify and change unhelpful actions (behaviours) and thinking patterns (cognitions).

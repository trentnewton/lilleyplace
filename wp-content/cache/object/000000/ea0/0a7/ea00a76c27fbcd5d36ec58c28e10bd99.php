I have reflected on some of the things that I have learnt from my work, and I have found that my greatest rewards have come from my greatest challenges.  -->For me, my work allows me to make a difference. The vision and action may not change the world. But perhaps changing one thing, for one person, may allow that person to change the world. Through our clinic and research we have made a meaningful difference to the lives of many and that, in turn, creates a positive ripple effect.";}

In the first stage of therapy, your therapist will conduct a thorough assessment aimed at identifying your schemas. You may be requested to complete questionnaires and to engage in experiential techniques (for example, imagery). In the second stage of therapy, the emotional awareness and experiential phase, your therapist will help you to get in touch with these schemas and learn how to become more aware of them when they are impacting on your everyday life. In the third and final stage of therapy, the behavioural change stage, your therapist will guide you in replacing negative, habitual thoughts and behaviours with alternative thoughts and behaviours that are more likely to work better for you and improve your day-to-day life.</p>";}

    <p>Referrals are accepted from medical professionals, allied health professionals, school staff, parents and individuals. Written referrals are not required when seeing a psychologist under private health insurance. However, referrals are required from either a GP, Paediatrician or Psychiatrist in order to access rebates under the Medicare Scheme.</p>
    <p>A number of different psychotherapies exist. All psychologists at Lilley Place are trained primarily in the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviours and how they effect and maintain emotional and behavioural difficulties experienced. CBT is goal orientated and focuses on problem solving and relapse prevention. Skills from other therapies can also be utilised depending on the nature of the presenting problem. Other therapies often incorporated include Schema-Focused Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Interpersonal therapy (IPT) and Mindfulness based CBT.</p>

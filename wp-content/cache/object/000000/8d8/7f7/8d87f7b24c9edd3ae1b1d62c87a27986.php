Your psychologist will develop a treatment plan for you, which could involve you working with your therapist as an active participant in your therapy. You might practice techniques between sessions (‚Äúhomework‚Äù), involving, for example, mindfulness strategies that improve your present moment awareness, and/or complete work sheets to clarify your personal life values. Over the course of therapy, your therapist will take you through the as many of the six principles of ACT that are warranted, so that you can learn skills to help you to accept and experience uncomfortable emotions, to distance yourself from unhelpful thoughts, and to connect with the present moment in order to achieve your goals and to live by your chosen values. This could involve engaging in experiential and verbal techniques aimed at targeting avoidance of emotions, both with your therapist during sessions and as homework between sessions.</p>";}

ÀŸµU<?php exit; ?>a:1:{s:7:"content";s:1040:"<p>CBT requires a comprehensive assessment where a psychologist will find out what is going on for you and what is contributing to and maintaining those issues. Your psychologist will develop a treatment plan for you, which will require you to work with your therapist as an active participant in your therapy. You will also be required to practice strategies provided by your therapist between sessions (‚Äúhomework‚Äù). This may include completing forms, practising strategies that you have learned in sessions (e.g., breathing and relaxation techniques), and performing actions (for example, doing things that increase or decrease behaviours). Your therapist will work with you to identify unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your difficulties, and to replace these with more realistic, effective thoughts and behaviours. CBT aims not only to help you with your current problems, but to provide you with the skills to be able to reduce the likelihood that you will experience similar problems in the future.</p>";}

    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>Sessions are typically 50 minutes in duration and all costs are advised prior to the initial consultation and vary according to your needs and service. Many clients are eligible for rebates through Medicare or their Private Health cover. All fees are payable at the time of consultation and a variety of payment options exist (cash, cheque, EFTPOS).</p>
    <p>Phone consultations are available, but any calls for 15 minutes or more will attract a fee. The fees are assessed pro rata based on the psychologist's normal appointment rate. For example, a 30 minute phone call will be assessed at half of the psychologist's normal appointment rate. Skype sessions for both therapy and clinical supervision will be assessed pro rata. Letter writing and emails will also be assessed pro rata.</p>
    <p>Health rebates are available for patients with Private Health Cover. Clients are provided with a statement at the time of payment and this can be taken to the private health fund to receive a rebate. As each health fund and level of cover relates to different rebate allowances, each client is encouraged to discuss rebates directly with their fund.</p>
    <p>Families without private health insurance are entitled to claim expenses for psychological services as a tax rebate at the end of each financial year.</p>
    <p>There are options for rebates through Medicare. To be eligible to access services under this scheme, patients must have a diagnosed mental health disorder and be referred by their GP, Psychiatrist or Paediatrician. Patients will be able to access up to 10 individual sessions per calendar year with maximum rebates from Medicare. Again, payment must be made at the time of consultation, and then rebates claimed directly through Medicare. As a convenience for clients, Medicare claims can be processed by Reception at the time of payment and rebates deposited directly into a savings account.</p>
    <p>If you are unable to make an appointment, please call and reschedule as soon as possible. Late cancellations mean that other clients are not able to access assistance that otherwise would have been available. If 48 hours notice is not given to change or cancel an appointment, a cancellation fee will be charged.</p>
    <p>Below you will find a list of each psychologist's appointment rate and the corresponding Medicare rebate.</p>

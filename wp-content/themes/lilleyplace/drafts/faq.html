    <a href="#faq">What is the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?</a>
    <div id="faq" class="content">
      <p>Clinical psychologists complete a minimum of six or seven years of university-level study, and have expertise in the area of human behaviour. Although clinical psychologists frequently have doctoral degrees and are referred to as “doctor”, they do not have medical degrees, and are not able to prescribe medications. Rather, psychologists assess clients and then use scientifically supported therapies (for example, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) in working with clients to achieve their goals, improve their quality of life, and function more healthily and effectively on a day-to-day basis. Psychologists, therefore, help clients with a wide range of problems, including changing behaviours (e.g., smoking, problems with eating or motivation), managing stress, and clinical diagnoses, such as depression and anxiety. Psychiatrists, on the other hand, study for six years to obtain a general medical degree, and then complete further study to gain additional qualifications in the area of mental health. They may prescribe medication and use therapy-based strategies to treat mental health problems. Psychologists and psychiatrists often work together. Some psychiatrists focus primarily on medication, and refer clients to psychologists for non-medical therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy).</p>

    <a href="#faq-2">What is CBT?</a>
    <div id="faq-2" class="content">
      <p>CBT or “Cognitive Behavioural Therapy” is a form of therapy that helps clients to identify and change unhelpful actions (behaviours) and thinking patterns (cognitions). CBT focuses on your present thoughts and behaviours and how they affect how you feel.</p>

    <a href="#faq-3">What types of problems can be addressed with CBT?</a>
    <div id="faq-3" class="content">
      <p>Numerous research studies over many years have supported the effectiveness of CBT, and for some problems (e.g.,depression), CBT has been shown to be as effective as anti-depressant medications in minimising and treating symptoms. This type of therapy is helpful for people experiencing a wide range of difficulties and with all age groups (children, adolescents, adults, and older adults). The types of problems CBT addresses include anxiety (including panic, phobias, generalised anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder), depression, stress, anger management, low self-esteem, adjustment difficulties, managing and coping with the effects of health problems (e.g., fatigue, pain), eating disorders (e.g., bulimia), post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder.</p>

    <a href="#faq-4">What will the treatment process be like with CBT?</a>
    <div id="faq-4" class="content">
      <p>CBT requires a comprehensive assessment where a psychologist will find out what is going on for you and what is contributing to and maintaining those issues. Your psychologist will develop a treatment plan for you, which will require you to work with your therapist as an active participant in your therapy. You will also be required to practice strategies provided by your therapist between sessions (“homework”). This may include completing forms, practising strategies that you have learned in sessions (e.g., breathing and relaxation techniques), and performing actions (for example, doing things that increase or decrease behaviours). Your therapist will work with you to identify unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your difficulties, and to replace these with more realistic, effective thoughts and behaviours. CBT aims not only to help you with your current problems, but to provide you with the skills to be able to reduce the likelihood that you will experience similar problems in the future.</p>

    <div id="faq-5" class="content">
      <p>Schema Therapy is essentially a combination of specific aspects of a range of therapies, including cognitive, behavioural, experiential, interpersonal and psychoanalytic therapies. The aim of Schema Therapy is to examine a client’s history so that core unmet needs from childhood can be identified. Identification of these unmet needs helps to determine unhealthy beliefs (schemas) that are impacting on a client’s present life.</p>

    <div id="faq-7" class="content">
      <p>Schema Therapy comprises three stages. In the first stage of therapy, your therapist will conduct a thorough assessment aimed at identifying your schemas. You may be requested to complete questionnaires and to engage in experiential techniques (for example, imagery). In the second stage of therapy, the emotional awareness and experiential phase, your therapist will help you to get in touch with these schemas and learn how to become more aware of them when they are impacting on your everyday life. In the third and final stage of therapy, the behavioural change stage, your therapist will guide you in replacing negative, habitual thoughts and behaviours with alternative thoughts and behaviours that are more likely to work better for you and improve your day-to-day life.</p>

    <div id="faq-8" class="content">
      <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness-based form of Cognitive Behavioural therapy. The overarching aim of ACT is to help you to achieve two main goals: (1) to effectively handle painful thoughts and feelings, and (2) to create a rich, full and meaningful life. The ACT approach suggests that our attempts to control, limit, or push away inner experiences cause emotional suffering, by way of constricting our lives and disconnecting us from what we value most.</p>

You might practice techniques between sessions (“homework”), involving, for example, mindfulness strategies that improve your present moment awareness, and/or complete work sheets to clarify your personal life values. Over the course of therapy, your therapist will take you through the as many of the six principles of ACT that are warranted, so that you can learn skills to help you to accept and experience uncomfortable emotions, to distance yourself from unhelpful thoughts, and to connect with the present moment in order to achieve your goals and to live by your chosen values. This could involve engaging in experiential and verbal techniques aimed at targeting avoidance of emotions, both with your therapist during sessions and as homework between sessions.</p>

    <div id="faq-14" class="content">
      <p>Emotion-Focused Therapy is a type of therapy aimed at promoting healthy emotion regulation. Emotions are a valuable information system, however with traumatic experiences this system can become altered. Many people who enter therapy experience either heightened emotions (e.g., excessive anxiety, guilt, or shame) and/or suppression of others (e.g., healthy assertion, joy).</p>
      <p>Emotion-focused therapy is based on emotion theory and attachment theory, and can help clients to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Differentiate between different emotion states.</li>
        <li>Regulate maladaptive emotions and increase adaptive emotion states.</li>
        <li>Use emotions as a guide.</li>
        <li>Allow for greater levels of emotional intimacy in relationships.</li>

      <p>Psychodynamic psychotherapy encompasses a range of different therapy approaches where the focus is on understanding and becoming aware of thoughts and feelings that were previously outside the person’s conscious, in order to provide relief from emotional pain. Much of the work is focused on how childhood experiences affect us as adults, in particular the development of self esteem, coping skills and patterns of interpersonal relating. It is generally a longer-term therapy approach which focuses on character and personality change as well as symptom relief.</p>
      <p>Psychodynamic psychotherapy may provide clients with:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>A sense of support and understanding for distressing issues.</li>
       <li>A greater understanding of how their own internal dynamics affect mood, behaviour and relationships.</li>
       <li>More choices and options for problem-solving and coping.</li>
       <li>An opportunity to work through and process distressing memories from childhood.</li>

      <h4>Medicare</h4>
      <p>There are several options for rebates under the Medicare system. You may like to discuss these programs further with your doctor. More information can also be found at <a href="http://www.health.gov.au" target="_blank">Department of Health</a>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h6>HCWA</h6>
          <p>HCWA Medicare Items can be used in addition to the HCWA Early Intervention package or may apply if not eligible for the Early Intervention package (e.g., over 6 years when diagnosed, over 7 years for treatment or package limit has been reached). You do not need to be registered with HCWA to use these Medicare Items. A referral from a psychiatrist, paediatrician or GP is required.</p>
          <p>The services include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Up to four diagnostic / assessment services to assist the referring practitioner with diagnosis or to contribute to a child’s treatment and management plan (for a child under thirteen years of age).</li>
            <li>Up to twenty treatment sessions (for a child under fifteen years of age, providing they have a treatment and management plan in place by thirteen).</li>

    <div id="faq-20" class="content">
      <p>The NDIS is due to be rolled out in Queensland from July 2016. The NDIS is a new way for people to get disability support that takes an individualised and life-long approach through community linkages and individualised funding plans. Participants will have their needs assessed and work with local people to develop a plan for their care and support. HCWA has been identified for transition to the NDIS. Unlike HCWA the NDIS provides support that can continue through to adulthood.</p>
      <p>Once the NDIS is accessible in your area, you will be able to complete an Access Request Form, which can be provided to you by the National Disability Insurance Agency. You will continue to have access to your remaining HCWA funds until your NDIS plan is approved as long as you have submitted this form. Support packages under NDIS will be based on your assessment and individual needs. You will continue to be able to choose the service providers you would like to allocate your funding to under this new system. This will ensure consistency in care.

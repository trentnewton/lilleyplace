    <p>A number of different psychotherapies exist. All psychologists at Lilley Place are trained primarily in the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviours and how they effect and maintain emotional and behavioural difficulties experienced. CBT is goal orientated and focuses on problem solving and relapse prevention. Skills from other therapies can also be utilised depending on the nature of the presenting problem. Other therapies often incorporated include Schema-Focused Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Interpersonal therapy (IPT) and Mindfulness based CBT.</p>

    <p>El has over a decade of experience in the field of Psychology. She uses a variety of approaches that she believes will be most effective based on both the issue she is working with and the experience she has in understanding what will best suit the person she is assisting.

El believes that much of our deeper present day struggles are linked to past experiences and perhaps the unresolved or non-addressed understandings or emotions associated with them. El also believes that often the issues presented in counselling are rather the symptoms of the underlining issue and hence it is often ‘deeper’ therapy as opposed to ‘band aid’ therapy that provides positive and sustainable change.</p>

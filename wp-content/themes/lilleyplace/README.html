<h1 id="lilleyplacewordpresstheme">Lilley Place Wordpress Theme</h1>

<p>This theme is built on <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a>, check out the docs to get a grasp of some of the features that are being used.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>This theme is using Sass instead of normal CSS, so please don&#8217;t edit style.css, there&#8217;s nothing there but Wordpress theme info. Instead please look at /assets/scss instead if you want to make changes to the theme.</p>

<p>The Sass has been compiled using <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> and outputs to /assets/css. Planning to move over to Gulp in the near future.</p>

<p>The Javascript has been concatenated using Codekit too and outputs to /assets/js/min.</p>

<p>The language files have been made using <a href="https://poedit.net">Poedit</a> and are in the /languages folder.</p>

<p>This theme has number of dependencies and they need to be installed and activaed as Wordpress plugins for it to function properly.
The list is here:</p>

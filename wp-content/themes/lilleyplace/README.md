# Lilley Place Wordpress Theme

This theme is built on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), check out the docs while you are there to get a grasp of some of the features that are being used.

## Requirements

This theme is using Sass instead of normal CSS, so please don't edit style.css, there's nothing there but Wordpress theme info. Instead please look at /assets/scss instead if you want to make changes to the theme.

The Sass has been compiled using [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) and outputs to /assets/css. Planning to move over to Gulp in the near future.

The Javascript has been concatenated using Codekit too and outputs to /assets/js/min.

The language files have been made using [Poedit](https://poedit.net) and are in the /languages folder.
